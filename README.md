Wimpy Shell
===========

This is a project I did for Com Sci 352, Introduction to Operating Systems. The program
consists of a simple (or wimpy as my professor decided to call it) linux shell that can be 
used instead of bash, etc. It's capable of a couple interesting features including
background jobs and piped commands.

The original .txt readme file is included here if you want more information.
